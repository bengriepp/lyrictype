IDEA:

Pro mode - words from the lyrics are missing and must
be filled in from knowledge


PROBLEM:
server is setup to handle one connection at a time by storing the currently searched artist

solutions:
temporarily store



TODO:
[x] gui
    [x] screen for typing in artist
    [x] screen for results
    [x] focus function that focuses either input based on state of document


[x] next song autoloading
[x] remove parantheses
[~] replace untypable characters
[x] move '&' checking to index by passing boolean through url
[x] remember current artist, create routing function to fetch next page of songs of current artist
[x] search button
[x] tab index buttons
[ ] check input against artist name

[x] album cover changes before loading next song
[x] font sizing
[ ] responsive design
[ ] second preload
[ ] loading icon
[ ] website name
[x] make buttons unclickable when not loaded

LOW PRIORITY:
[ ] use verses of inputted artist first
[ ] only allow spaces to be typed on spaces for formatting

BUGS:

[x] if searched artists top song is a feature, will show different artist
[x] sometimes requires a space at the end for some reason lol
[x] some songs just like dont work (mackelmore, mazzy star)
[ ] can return genius articles if top result
[x] timer doesn't wait for typing
[x] array reference error when results less than 20
[x] some songs dont contain brackets which stops songs from loading
[x] unable to return songs that do not have 4 lines without brackets
[x] when preload fails, loads next page and song even if page has remaining results
[ ] unfocus quote type after done
[x] if first song doesn't load, no songs load
